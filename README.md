# rae-accessions-to-repositories
The Annual Accessions to Repositories survey is a UK-wide exercise conducted by the National Archives that gathere information on what is being collected by UK repositories. The primary purpose of this exercise is to place some of this information onto TNAâ€™s search engine Discovery. More recently, the data has been used to communicate accessions trends to the wider archives sector including information on what is being collected and where. Each year, TNA sends out survey templates in the form of Excel spreadsheets that are sent out to repositories in each part of the UK. The returns sent to TNA include information on the size of the record, the dates it covers, the creator of the record and a description of the record. Work has been undertaken since October 2021 to to merge and standardise the accessions data held by TNA. This data repository presents the merged dataset and the processes that formulated it.
